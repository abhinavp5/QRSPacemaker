This project aims to design and evaluate a signal-processing pipeline capable of detecting irregular QRS complexes from raw ecg signals based on the paper by Pan-tompking1. The primary goal is to extract accurate R-peak locations and timing characteristics (RR intervals, variability patterns, and abnormal beat signatures) directly from raw ECG recordings. These timing metrics will then be mapped onto simplified pacemaker-relevant decision logic to simulate how a pacemaker interprets irregular cardiac rhythms, inhibits or triggers pacing, and maintains stable heart rhythm during abnormal events. Our plan is to implement preprocessing filters, develop a robust Pan–Tompkins QRS detector, compute irregularity metrics, and integrate these outputs into a pacing-decision model.
